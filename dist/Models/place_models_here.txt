Background removal models in onnx format can be downloaded from these locations:

Interactive Models
- Segment Anything + mobile-sam: 
  https://huggingface.co/vietanhdev/segment-anything-onnx-models/tree/main
  SAM model required for point and click background removal. I recommend using mobile-sam as it has near instant results

Whole-image models
- rembg: 
  https://huggingface.co/briaai/RMBG-1.4/tree/main/onnx
    
- u2net, disnet, BiRefNet, Segment Anything, and more: 
  https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg/releases/tag/v0.0.0

Place the models (or symlinks if located elsewhere) in this folder

If using quantised Segment Anything models, these require the .quant suffix before .encoder in the filename, which is the opposite of how they are downloaded from the links above.


The following models are hardcoded, simply add to this section in the python script if you want to include a different model.

# will also match quantised versions .quant
sam_models = [
            "mobile_sam",
            "sam_vit_b_01ec64", 
            "sam_vit_h_4b8939",
            "sam_vit_l_0b3195",
            ]

whole_models = [
        "rmbg1_4",
        "rmbg1_4-quant",
        "isnet-general-use",
        "isnet-anime",
        "u2net",
        "BiRefNet", # matches all birefnet variations
]
